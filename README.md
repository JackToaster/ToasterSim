# ToasterSim
The Flying Toasters' robot simulator developed through the 2017 off-season. 

There are two unity projects in this repository:
ToasterSim, which uses better rendering and can be controlled by UDP messages, and ToasterSimVr, which uses little realtime lighting and is optimized for running on an android phone with google cardboard.
